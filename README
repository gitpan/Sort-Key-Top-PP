NAME
    Sort::Key::Top::PP - pure Perl implementation of parts of Sort::Key::Top

SYNOPSIS
            use Sort::Key::Top::PP 'top';
            my @top5 = top 5 => @biglist;

DESCRIPTION
    Sort::Key::Top::PP is set of functions for finding the top "n" items in an
    array by some criteria. It's not as fast as Sort::Key::Top, but it is
    generally quite a bit faster than sorting the entire array and taking the
    first "n" items.

    This module implements pure Perl equivalents of the following functions as
    descibed in Sort::Key::Top.

    *   `top`

    *   `topsort`

    *   `keytop`

    *   `keytopsort`

    *   `ntop`

    *   `ntopsort`

    *   `nkeytop`

    *   `nkeytopsort`

    *   `rtop`

    *   `rtopsort`

    *   `rkeytop`

    *   `rkeytopsort`

    *   `rntop`

    *   `rntopsort`

    *   `rnkeytop`

    *   `rnkeytopsort`

    *   `head`

    *   `nhead`

    *   `keyhead`

    *   `nkeyhead`

    *   `tail`

    *   `ntail`

    *   `keytail`

    *   `nkeytail`

    By default *all functions are exported*. If you don't like that, then
    please specify an explicit list of functions to import, a la:

       use Sort::Key::Top::PP qw( top );
